        <h2>Natural Disasters effect in Housing Pricing in USA</h2>
         <p class="text-justify">Natural Disasters is the one of the most threaten to the people live in US, the natural disaster include but not limited to hurricane, 
		tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, and snowstorm. </p>
		
         <p class="text-justify">In many cases the president of united states can declare an emergency when the president determines 
		a federal assistance may needed providing emergency services, 
		such as the protection of lives, property, public health, and safety. 
		The impact of these disaster has a direct effect on the resident in different way, 
		some these effects are economics implications or sometimes psychological or moral effects.</p>

		       <h3>Analysis Fema data</h3>
                 <p class="text-justify">The objective of this project is to study the behavior of these natural disasters and their impact on the US economy, 
				   and we will be focusing on the effects on Housing pricing. It’s very clear that some types of these natural disaster like hurricane, 
				   tsunami and earthquake has a major impact on the properties like houses and building, and the areas that declare as 
				   a potential disasters area has more risk than other and properties in these areas has least attract people and developers. </p>
				   <p class="text-justify">In this project I am going to study this hypothesis by using a natural disaster data for all disaster declared by the president since 1953 created 
				   by (Federal Emergency Management Agency – FEMA). I am going to use data for only 10 years from 2007-2017 in this project and join the disaster data 
				   with data of Housing Price Index created by (Zillow – one of the major real state databases in US) also for the period of 10 years from 2007-2017.</p>
